Ideas
---
- More simple code or less complex code - human vs compiler. Benefits of readability.
- Cucumber and the use of I.
- Architecture: example of a system with mutable data with traditional domain boundaries and immutable data split by mutability boundaries.
-  Code reviews - human factor - categorize feedback - leave room for others - let your way not be the only way.
- Creating tickets - what's out of scope.
- Flatten the load.
- Memory leaks, Visual VM, jmx.
